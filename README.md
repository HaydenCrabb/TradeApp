# TradeApp
The fun teaching simulation for the economics classroom. 

The trade app is designed to be a fun simulation game for an economics classroom. A professor, using the accompanying TradeApp Teachers app, sets up a simulation. Students then join in using a class code. In the simulation the student's goal is to make as much money as possible by building products. They do this using the resources they have. However, they will never have enough to build with their own resources alone, so they must trade. After the simulation is over the teacher can teach a variety of economic priniciples off of what happened in the game.
